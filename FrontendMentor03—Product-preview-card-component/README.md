## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex

### What I learned

### What I Learned Today:

- **\<picture\> Tag:**
    - Discovered and utilized the \<picture\> tag in HTML, a powerful tool for responsive image handling.
    - Learned how to interchange image files based on specific screen sizes using the `srcset` attribute.

- **ARIA Attributes:**
    - Implemented ARIA attributes, such as `aria-label`, to enhance accessibility in web development.

- **Grid Layout:**
    - Utilized the CSS Grid layout extensively for a project.
    - Explored less common grid properties, including the use of `auto` to dynamically allocate space based on content.

### Code Highlights

- ARIA attributes

  ```html
      <p class="price" data-item-type="strong" aria-label="Price: $149.99">$149.99</p>
  
  ```

- Picture and source tag:
  ```html
  <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 599px)" srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg">
            <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
            <img class="product-image" src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum image">
        </picture>
  ```
- use of `auto` in grid:
  ```css
  .price-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
    gap: 1rem;
    align-items: center;
  }
  ```
