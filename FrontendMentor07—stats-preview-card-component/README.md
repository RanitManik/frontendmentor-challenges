## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- responsiveness

### What I learned

- **HTML Accessibility with Semantic Tags:**
  When developing your HTML, prioritize accessibility by incorporating semantic tags. These tags,
  explained [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics), not only enhance search engine
  discoverability but also ensure that individuals with disabilities can navigate and utilize your site. In some
  jurisdictions, the accessibility of websites carries legal implications. It's crucial to avoid overusing generic divs,
  as they lack semantic value.

- **Logical Control with `box-sizing: border-box;`:**
  To maintain logical control over elements in your project, consider adding the CSS property `box-sizing: border-box;`.
  This recommendation ensures that the specified width/height corresponds to the actual dimensions rendered on the
  screen.
  Embracing this approach contributes to a more predictable layout.

- **Optimal Font Loading in HTML:**
  For consistent font rendering, it's advisable to include font links directly within your HTML. By doing so, your site
  maintains its original fonts even if the CSS hasn't fully loaded. This practice prevents the reliance on browser
  defaults, resulting in a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.

### Code Highlights

- using css reset correctly
  ```css
  * {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    }
  ```
