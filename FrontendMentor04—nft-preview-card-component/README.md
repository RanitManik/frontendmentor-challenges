## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned an alternative method to stack two elements without using the `position: absolute` property. By leveraging
  the power of `display: grid`, I was able to achieve this efficiently.
- I explored creating a transparent overlay on an image. This effect, triggered on hover, adds a subtle and visually
  appealing touch to the design.
- I implemented a smooth transition effect on an element when interacting with its parent element. This enhances the
  overall user experience.

## Code Highlights

- use grid to stack up two items
  ```css
  .card-img-container {
    place-items: center;
    transition: opacity 0.25s;
  }
  
  .card-img-container img {
    grid-column: 1/-1;
    grid-row: 1/-1;
  }
  ```

- transparent overlay on an image on hover
  ```css
  .card-img-container {
    border-radius: var(--border-radius-secondary);
    overflow: hidden;
    cursor: pointer;
    position: relative;
  }
  
  .card-img-container::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.25s;
  }

  .card-img-container:hover::before {
      opacity: 1;
  }
  ```
- apply a transition effect to an element when interacting to its parent element
  ```css
  .icon-view-svg {
      opacity: 0;
  }
  
  .card-img-container:hover .icon-view-svg {
      opacity: 1;
  }
  ```
